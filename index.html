          <p>My name is Jennifer Hou.  I am an experienced Java developer who has worked on various projects.  I recently graduated from the Georgia Tech Coding boot camp where I developed 5 full stack web applications from mockup to deployment, two of which used React front-end.</p>
          <p>Through the boot camp, I was able to further strengthen my developer skills by creating the applications from design to completion with JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, jQuery.  Create, build and consume REST APIs. I enjoy learning new technology like Node.js and applying them to my projects to solidify my technical skills.</p>
          <p>My goal is to work for a company where I can continue to learn and grow and be able to maintain up-to-date knowledge on rapidly changing technology.</p>
