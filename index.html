          <p>My name is Jennifer Hou.  I was born in Taiwan and have been living in Georgia for the past 20 years. I received my master’s degree from Purdue University and earned the Sun Java Programmer certificate upon completing a Java Coding Boot Camp in 2000.  Since then, I have been working as a Java developer and participated in various application projects.  In the year of 2010, I decided to stay home where my kids needed me the most.  I am glad that I had the chance to be there for my children when the family activities became overwhelming.</p>
          <p>Both of my kids were born and raised in Georgia.  My son is in his 2nd year at the Medical College of Georgia and my daughter is a freshman at Cornell University. My husband serves as the director of a research and technology department.  Seeing that all my family members were busy reaching goals in their lives, I too desired to have something of my own.  I pushed myself to earned a certificate for medical interpretation in Mandarin last year.  I was so encouraged when I passed both the written and verbal exams with flying colors.  While studying for the medical interpreter training course, I realized that I am most happy when I can continue learning and I realized that my love for programming is still strong.  I then decided to search up a good coding boot camp to help me sharpen my skills for all the new web technologies.</p>
          <p>Inevitably I have fears that trying to get back to coding again.  “The more I learn the more I realize the less I know.”  ― Michel Legrand.  That’s exactly how I feel throughout the entire boot camp course. However, I am also telling myself to think in a positive way. “You'll never know everything about anything, especially something you love.”  ― Julia Child.  I told myself  that I should be proud that I have taken the first step out and I am taking a step at a time!</p>
